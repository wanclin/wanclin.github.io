Hello I'm Wan-Chen! ‚ú®

![academic journey](/images/lin-academic-journey.jpg)

## About Me

I am a public health researcher with over four years of experience in epidemiological research, focusing on **how social and physical environments influence mental health and child development**. I am passionate about using quantitative and mixed-methods approaches to uncover the stories hidden within data.

Currently, I am a **Master of Public Health student** at the **University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill**, concentrating in Health Behavior with a minor in Epidemiology. Here, I also serve as a Graduate Research Assistant in the Department of Epidemiology. Originally from Taiwan, I earned my B.S. in Public Health from Taipei Medical University and am a nationally certified Public Health Specialist.

My research interests are fundamentally driven by a fascination with resilience. I aim to understand the complex ways in which adversity affects mental health, and to identify the protective factors and coping mechanisms that enable individuals and communities to flourish despite challenges. This pursuit is also a personal exploration of how we cultivate inner strength in an era of constant challenge and change. I believe public health is fundamentally about people, and science‚Äîboth natural and social science‚Äîhas the power to make their lives better.

To know more about my academic experiences, please visit üëâ [Research Projects](https://wanclin.github.io/research-projects/) and [CV](https://wanclin.github.io/cv/).

In my free time, I enjoy listening to Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff üéµ, reading books üìö, and exploring Vedic Astrology and Tarot üîÆ. I also love playing badminton üè∏.

## Current Focus

My present work spans several key areas of maternal mental health and child health:
* **Bachpan Study**: Investigating the links between maternal mental health, parental engagement, and child well-being in a longitudinal cohort study.
* **Postpartum Eating Disorders**: Conducting a scoping review to identify the current evidence and gaps on eating disorders among postpartum women and their offspring.
* **MPH Capstone**: Collaborating with the NC Division of Public Health, Injury and Violence Prevention Branch, to develop place-based cannabis resources for injury and violence prevention.

## Skills & Methodologies

I am proficient in the full research cycle, from study design and data collection to analysis and academic writing.

## Future Directions & Learning in Progress

I am a self-motivated and curious learner, constantly expanding my toolkit. Beyond my current skills, I‚Äôm deeply interested in the intersection of technology, neuroscience, and mental health.

* üí° **AI in Mental Health**: I'm exploring how machine learning can be applied‚Äîappropriately, effectively, and ethically‚Äîto predict mental health outcomes. I'm also interested in how generative AI can be integrated into mHealth interventions to support mental well-being.

* üß† **Neuroscience of Mental Disorders**: I'm eager to deepen my understanding of fMRI and related methods to uncover the neural mechanisms underlying mental illness.

* üìà **Advanced Quantitative Methods**: I'm actively developing skills in longitudinal data analysis (e.g., GEE, GBTM, DLNM), multilevel modeling, and structural equation modeling to better analyze complex mental health data.

## Open to Collaboration ü§ù

I am an early-career scholar eager to contribute to the academic world. I welcome collaborations on topics related to:

* Mental Health & Psychiatric Epidemiology
* Perinatal, Maternal, and Child Health
* Suicide Prevention
* Substance Use
* Climate Change and Health
* mHealth & Digital Behavior Change Interventions

I can assist with data analysis, survey development, intervention evaluation, literature reviews, and manuscript writing. If our interests align, or I can support your work in any way, please feel free to reach out to me at [is.wclin@gmail.com](mailto:is.wclin@gmail.com)!
