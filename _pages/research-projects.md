    I currently work as a Graduate Research Assistant of the <b>Bachpan Study</b>, a longitudinal cohort study led by Dr. Joanna “Asia” Maselko. The study has followed over 1,000 mother–child pairs in Pakistan since 2014, beginning in the mothers’ third trimester. It explores maternal psychosocial health, family environment, and child development outcomes.

My responsibilities include conducting quantitative data analyses and creating dissemination materials to communicate findings with participating households. I am currently leading a project examining the relationship between maternal parental engagement, maternal mental health, and children’s learning outcomes.

## Scoping Review on Eating Disorders Among Postpartum Women

*December 2024 - Present*

This is the first research project I joined after moving to the U.S., in collaboration with Marina Pearsall, MPH, RD, and Nisha O’Shea, PhD, at RTI International. The review focuses on maternal mental health, infant feeding practices, and screening strategies for eating disorders in postpartum women.

I contributed to screening over 600 articles, assessing study quality, and extracting data from more than 30 eligible studies. I am now co-authoring a manuscript based on the findings for submission to a peer-reviewed journal.

## Primary Care Training Enhancement – Residency Training in Mental and Behavioral Health

*Department of Family Medicine, UNC School of Medicine*
*May 2025 - July 2025*

As part of my MPH practicum, I contributed to the Evaluation of Residency Training in Mental and Behavioral Health_ initiative by developing two deliverables:
1. **Qualitative Study on PGY1 Residents’ Perspectives (n = 24)**
	- Conducted a qualitative analysis of how first-year family medicine residents perceive their role in delivering mental and behavioral health (MBH) care.
	- Residents often saw themselves as both the frontline providers and a bridge between patients and specialized mental health services. However, some ambiguity remains around the scope of primary care providers (PCPs) in addressing mental health.
	- A manuscript based on this work is currently in preparation for submission to a peer-reviewed journal.
2. **Literature Review Report: Integration of Mental and Behavioral Health in Primary Care**
	- Conducted a scoping review of over 6,000 studies; 16 met the inclusion criteria.
	- The review identified current practices, PCP roles, and key barriers in MBH care integration within primary care settings.
	- **PCP Roles in MBH Care:**
		- Screening, assessment, diagnosis
		- Treatment and referral
		- Care coordination and follow-up
	- **Identified Barriers:**
		- Referral system and navigation challenges
		- Administrative burden
		- Limited interprofessional communication
		- Lack of confidence and training among PCPs
		- Patient engagement difficulties
		- Time constraints and reimbursement issues
		- Additional barriers: stigma, patient/provider characteristics, systemic fragmentation
	- **Recommendations:**
		- Enhance training for PCPs in managing complex psychiatric conditions
		- Improve interprofessional collaboration skills
		- Leverage technology to streamline communication and referral processes
		- Adapt MBH interventions to the realities of primary care
		- Provide institutional support for PCP well-being and self-care
