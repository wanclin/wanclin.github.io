My responsibilities include conducting quantitative data analyses and creating dissemination materials to communicate findings with participating households. I am currently leading a project examining the relationship between maternal parental engagement, maternal mental health, and children’s learning outcomes.

## Scoping Review on Eating Disorders Among Postpartum Women

*December 2024 - Present*

This is the first research project I joined after moving to the U.S., in collaboration with Marina Pearsall, MPH, RD, and Nisha O’Shea, PhD, at RTI International. The review focuses on maternal mental health, infant feeding practices, and screening strategies for eating disorders in postpartum women.

I contributed to screening over 600 articles, assessing study quality, and extracting data from more than 30 eligible studies. I am now co-authoring a manuscript based on the findings for submission to a peer-reviewed journal.

## Primary Care Training Enhancement – Residency Training in Mental and Behavioral Health

*Department of Family Medicine, UNC School of Medicine*

*May 2025 - July 2025*

As part of my MPH practicum, I contributed to the evaluation of residency training program enhancing mental and behavioral health at UNC Department of Family Medicine by developing two deliverables:
1. **Qualitative Study on PGY1 Residents’ Perspectives (n = 24)**
	- Conducted a qualitative analysis of how first-year family medicine residents perceive their role in delivering mental and behavioral health (MBH) care.
	- We found that residents often saw themselves as both the frontline providers and a bridge between patients and specialized mental health services. However, some ambiguity remains around the scope of primary care providers (PCPs) in addressing mental health.
	- A manuscript based on this work is currently in preparation for submission to a peer-reviewed journal.
2. **Literature Review Report: Integration of Mental and Behavioral Health in Primary Care**
	- Conducted a scoping review of over 6,000 studies; 16 met the inclusion criteria.
	- The review identified current practices, PCP roles, and key barriers in MBH care integration within primary care settings.
    | **PCP Roles in MBH Care**          | **Identified Barriers**                      |
    |------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
    | - Screening, assessment, diagnosis | - Referral system and navigation challenges  |
    | - Treatment and referral           | - Administrative burden                      |
    | - Care coordination and follow-up  | - Limited interprofessional communication    |
    |                                    | - Lack of confidence and training among PCPs |
    |                                    | - Patient engagement difficulties            |
    |                                    | - Time constraints and reimbursement issues  |
	- **Recommendations:**
		- Enhance training for PCPs in managing complex psychiatric conditions
		- Improve interprofessional collaboration skills
		- Leverage technology to streamline communication and referral processes
		- Adapt MBH interventions to the realities of primary care
		- Provide institutional support for PCP well-being and self-care

## Longitudinal Examination across Prenatal and Postpartum Health in Taiwan (LEAPP-HIT)
[https://leapp-hit-eng.mystrikingly.com/](https://leapp-hit-eng.mystrikingly.com/)

*School of Public Health, Taipei Medical University*

*09/2021 – 06/2024

As an undergraduate, I joined Dr. Yi-Hua Chen’s research lab working on the **LEAPP-HIT Cohort Study**, a longitudinal investigation of over 2,000 households (mothers, fathers, and children) across 11 time points in Taiwan. My work spanned both independent research contributions and broader lab support.

### Selected Key Findings from my Work in the LEAPP-HIT Study:

- **Marital Quality & Prenatal Depression:** Better partner relationships during pregnancy were significantly associated with lower depressive symptoms. Stratified by resilience, this association held for fathers with high resilience but not for those with low resilience or for mothers, suggesting a moderating effect of psychological resilience.
- **Prenatal Temperature & Birth Outcomes:** Lower minimum temperatures during the third trimester were linked to higher risks of **low birth weight** and **preterm birth**. Adverse effects were more pronounced when babies were born in summer, as higher maximum temperatures also showed significant associations.
- **Green Space Exposure and Parental Well-Being:** Higher greenness around the residential area (measured by NDVI) was positively associated with maternal life satisfaction in the third trimester—but only among women delivering in summer. No significant associations were found for fathers.

### My Contributions:

- **Translation & Adaptation:** Translated and culturally adapted the **Flourishing Index** into Traditional Chinese.
- **Digital Tools:** Developed web-based mood tracking platforms using **Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)** methods.
- **Teaching:** Delivered a lab-wide lecture on **systematic review and meta-analysis** methods.
- **Data Management:**
    - Conducted **data entry and cleaning** for the cohort (11 waves, >2,000 families).
    - Developed **SAS code** to calculate total scores for standardized psychosocial scales (e.g., EPDS, STAI, PSQI).
    - Merged longitudinal LEAPP-HIT cohort data with other longitudinal environmental datasets.
- **Additional Projects:**
    - Supported data analysis for a **pregnancy-related anemia** project at Mackay Memorial Hospital’s OBGYN department.
    - EveLed the data preparation for a collaboration project of **deep learning** using LEAPP-HIT data with National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University.

## International Comparative Study of the Effectiveness of COVID-19 Control Measures in Taiwan and their Impact on Population Health

*School of Public Health, Taipei Medical University*
*07/2021 – 03/2024*

Also under Dr. Yi-Hua Chen's supervision, This project analyzes Taiwan's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, funded by Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taiwan. Our literature review found that Taiwan's early success in containing the virus was largely due to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and "soft lockdowns." However, a major outbreak in 2022 highlighted the critical need for robust medical resources, including stable vaccine and testing supplies, to complement NPIs. Following the stabilization of the domestic situation, emergency measures were phased out in May 2023. The report concludes by recommending the development of a data-driven, integrated surveillance system to ensure timely and effective responses to future epidemics.

In this project, I was responsible for:
- Lead the literature screening and extraction
- Draft the report

### My Reflections:

As the ancient text Sun Tzu's Art of War states: *"Do not rely on the enemy not coming, but on our own preparedness. Do not rely on the enemy not attacking, but on making ourselves unassailable."* I believe that in the face of future uncertainties, a proactive approach of learning from past experiences—both our own and others'—is far more constructive than passive fear. By reflecting on our journey and drawing lessons from global examples, we can build a more resilient and efficient epidemic response framework. While Taiwan's approach to COVID-19 had room for improvement, its initial success with NPIs offered a valuable model for the world in managing the early stages of a pandemic.

## Exploring the Health Status of the Elderly in Jincheng Township, Kinmen County: The Impact of Education Levels and Community-Based Health Promotion Programs

*Jincheng Health Center*
*07/2023 – 08/2023*

I finished my undergraduate practicum at Jinchen, Kinmen. Kinmen, an outlying island of Taiwan, possesses a unique socio-historical landscape shaped by its frontline position during the Cold War and its distinct role in contemporary cross-strait relations. Decades of military administration in the 20th century have profoundly influenced its development. Today, Kinmen faces the dual challenges of rapid population aging and limited local medical infrastructure. This often necessitates residents traveling to the main island of Taiwan for specialized care, and in severe or emergent cases, patients require medical evacuation (emergent referrals). This context makes promoting "active aging" and understanding local health disparities particularly critical. This project is one of the first to formally discuss social determinants of health and health equity within Kinmen's unique social context.

### Key Findings:
- Health Disparities: A higher level of education was significantly associated with better overall health status, highlighting the tangible impact of social determinants of health in this specific population.
- Program Effectiveness: The health promotion program demonstrated positive and significant effects on participants' cognition, muscle nutrition, and oral health. However, statistically significant improvements were not observed in daily functioning or psychosocial well-being, suggesting specific areas for future program enhancement.

## STAT6 Appears to Be a Potential Regulator of Galectin-3 in Tauopathy

*Neuroscience Program of Academia Sinica (NPAS), Institute of Biomedical Science, Academia Sinica*

*July 2022 - August 2022*

I was honored to be selected as one of the summer research student of Neuroscience Program of Academia Sinica in Dr. Yijaung Chern's Lab. I was trained in biodmedical laboratory teachniques and conducted experiments, analyze data,  I regularly presented my findings at lab meetings and delivered a formal presentation of my summer's work at the final NPAS Program symposium to an audience of peers and faculty. Our research findings finds that the xxx STAT6 may be the regulator of Galection-3, a protein promoting microglial activation and the spread of misfolded tau protein in nerodegenerative disease. Modulating this pathway could potentially mitigate pathway of Alzheimer's Disease progression.
