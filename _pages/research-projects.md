I currently work as a Graduate Research Assistant on the **Bachpan Study**, a longitudinal cohort study led by Dr. Joanna “Asia” Maselko. The study has followed over 1,000 mother–child pairs in Pakistan since 2014, beginning in the mothers’ third trimester. It explores maternal psychosocial health, family environment, and child development—covering cognitive, emotional, and school-related outcomes.  

My responsibilities include conducting quantitative data analyses and creating dissemination materials to communicate findings with participating households. I am currently leading a project examining the relationship between maternal parental engagement, maternal mental health, and children’s learning outcomes.
