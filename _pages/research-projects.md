# Current Projects

## Bachpan Study
[Link to the official website of the Bachpan Study](https://www.bachpanstudy.com/)

*Department of Epidemiology, UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health*<br>
*May 2025 - Present*

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: flex-start; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
  <div style="padding-right: 20px;">
    I currently serve as a Graduate Research Assistant for the <b>Bachpan Study</b>, a longitudinal cohort study led by Dr. Joanna “Asia” Maselko. The study has followed over 1,000 mother–child pairs in Pakistan since 2014, beginning in the mothers’ third trimester. It explores maternal psychosocial health, the family environment, and child development outcomes.
    <br><br>
    My responsibilities include conducting quantitative data analyses and creating dissemination materials to communicate findings with participating households. I am currently leading a project examining the relationship between maternal parental engagement, maternal mental health, and children’s learning outcomes.

## Primary Care Training Enhancement – Residency Training in Mental and Behavioral Health

*Department of Family Medicine, UNC School of Medicine*<br>
*May 2025 - July 2025*

As my MPH practicum, I contributed to the evaluation of a residency training program aimed at enhancing mental and behavioral health (MBH) at the UNC Department of Family Medicine. I developed two key deliverables:

1.  **Qualitative Study on PGY1 Residents’ Perspectives (n = 24)**
    - Conducted a qualitative analysis of how first-year family medicine residents perceive their role in delivering MBH care.
    - Findings indicated that residents see themselves as both frontline providers and a bridge to specialized services, though ambiguity remains regarding the scope of their role. A manuscript is in preparation for submission.

2.  **Literature Review Report: Integration of MBH in Primary Care**
    - Conducted a scoping review of over 6,000 studies, with 16 meeting the inclusion criteria.
    - The review identified current practices, PCP roles, and key barriers to MBH integration.
    | **PCP Roles in MBH Care** | **Identified Barriers** |
    |------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
    | - Screening, assessment, diagnosis | - Referral system and navigation challenges  |
    | - Treatment and referral           | - Administrative burden                      |
    | - Care coordination and follow-up  | - Limited interprofessional communication    |
    |                                    | - Lack of confidence and training among PCPs |
    |                                    | - Patient engagement difficulties            |
    |                                    | - Time constraints and reimbursement issues  |
    - **Recommendations** included enhancing PCP training, improving collaboration, leveraging technology, and providing institutional support.

# Completed Undergraduate Projects

## Relationship Between Instagram Use and Subjective Well-Being

*School of Public Health, Taipei Medical University*<br>
*July 2022 – February 2023*

As the Principal Investigator, I secured a competitive University Students Research Grant from the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC), Taiwan (Grant No. 111-2813-C-038-081-B; Value: NTD $58,000). My responsibilities encompassed the entire research cycle, including proposal writing, survey design, data collection, statistical analysis, and final report composition.

This project investigated the association between Instagram use and mental health among college students. Key findings indicated that Instagram usage time was not directly linked to mental health, whereas Instagram addiction was negatively associated with well-being and positively associated with depression. Resilience was found to be a significant moderator in these relationships.

The findings were presented at the 2023 European Public Health Conference and published in a supplement of *The European Journal of Public Health*, which has since garnered two citations. [Link to Poster](https://wanclin.github.io/files/eph_poster_2023.pdf).

## Longitudinal Examination across Prenatal and Postpartum Health in Taiwan (LEAPP-HIT)
[Link to the official website of the LEAPP-HIT Cohort Study (Eng. Version)](https://leapp-hit-eng.mystrikingly.com/)

*School of Public Health, Taipei Medical University*<br>
*September 2021 – June 2024*

As an undergraduate research assistant in Dr. Yi-Hua Chen’s lab, I worked on the **LEAPP-HIT Cohort Study**, a longitudinal project following over 2,000 households across 11 time points in Taiwan. My work included both independent research and broad lab support.

**Selected Key Findings from My Research:**
- **Marital Quality & Prenatal Depression:** Better partner relationships during pregnancy were associated with lower paternal depressive symptoms, a link moderated by resilience.
- **Prenatal Temperature & Birth Outcomes:** Lower third-trimester temperatures were linked to higher risks of low birth weight and preterm birth, with effects more pronounced for summer births.
- **Green Space & Parental Well-Being:** Higher residential greenness (NDVI) was positively associated with maternal life satisfaction, particularly for women delivering in summer.

**My Contributions:**
- **Research & Analysis:** Supported data analysis for a pregnancy-related anemia project and led data preparation for a deep learning collaboration with National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University.
- **Tool Development:** Translated and culturally adapted the **Flourishing Index** into Traditional Chinese; developed web-based mood tracking tools using **Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)**.
- **Data Management:** Performed data entry and cleaning for the 11-wave cohort; developed SAS code to score psychosocial scales; merged cohort data with longitudinal environmental datasets.
- **Teaching:** Delivered a lab-wide lecture on systematic review and meta-analysis methods.

## International Comparative Study on the Effectiveness of Taiwan's COVID-19 Control Measures
*School of Public Health, Taipei Medical University*<br>
*July 2021 – March 2024*

Under the supervision of Dr. Yi-Hua Chen, I contributed to this project funded by the Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare. The study analyzed Taiwan's pandemic response, finding that early success relied on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) but that later outbreaks highlighted the need for robust medical resources. The final report recommended developing a data-driven surveillance system for future epidemics.

**My Key Contributions:**
- Led the literature screening and extraction process.
- Drafted the final report summarizing research findings and policy recommendations.

## Health Status of the Elderly in Kinmen County: Impact of Education and Community Health Programs
*Jincheng Health Center, Kinmen County*<br>
*July 2023 – August 2023*

This undergraduate practicum explored health disparities and the effectiveness of health promotion in Kinmen, an outlying island of Taiwan with a unique socio-historical context and aging population. This project was one of the first to formally examine social determinants of health in Kinmen. 

**Key Findings:**
- **Health Disparities:** Higher education levels were significantly associated with better overall health status.
- **Program Effectiveness:** The community program significantly improved participants' cognition, muscle nutrition, and oral health, but not daily functioning or psychosocial well-being.

*Special thanks to my practicum preceptors, Pei-Chen Lin, MS, and Ya-Chuan Hsu, MD, at the Jincheng Health Center, and my academic advisor for practicum, Dr. Ying-Chih Chuang.*

## STAT6 as a Potential Regulator of Galectin-3 in Tauopathy
*Neuroscience Program of Academia Sinica (NPAS), Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica*<br>
*July 2022 - August 2022*

Selected for the competitive NPAS summer research program in Dr. Yijuang Chern's lab, I was trained in biomedical laboratory techniques. My project focused on the role of the transcription factor STAT6 in regulating Galectin-3, a protein involved in microglial activation and the spread of misfolded tau protein in neurodegenerative diseases.

Our findings suggest that STAT6 may regulate Galectin-3, indicating that modulating this pathway could be a potential therapeutic strategy for mitigating the progression of Alzheimer's Disease. I presented these findings at weekly lab meetings and at the final NPAS Program symposium.
